The Spheres of Support lists the technologies and features in the Network Security domain and defines support level for each item. It a pplies to Enterprise, SMB, US, International, unless otherwise noted.

Note that International NetSec also supports devices and technologies that are maintained by Security Support in the US. The support level of these features is described separately in Security Support Spheres of Support.


### Terminology

*  Supported - setup, configuration and troubleshooting.
*  Partial - setup, limited types of configuration and full troubleshooting of the supported configurations.
*  Reasonable endeavor - setup, attempt of configuration and attempt of troubleshooting.
   *   Use warning below when configuring a reasonable endeavor feature. 
*  Not supported - no setup or configuration provided.
   *   If an unsupported feature has to be supported on a device, this one-off has to be mentioned in the DMG by the Account Manager or the Lead Tech.
